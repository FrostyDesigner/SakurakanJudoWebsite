Objectives

    Set up the project folder for your first Bootstrap project as an NPM project folder.
    Use NPM to install the appropriate dependencies, and modify the package.json file. 
    Set up an index.html page as the homepage for your website, and insert the code necessary to use Bootstrap.


Instructions

Part 1: Initial setup
Create your course project folder and initialize it as an NPM project

    Locate your NucampFolder on your Desktop, and inside it, go into your 2-Bootstrap folder.
    Create a folder with the name nucampsite inside the 2-Bootstrap folder.
    Open it with VS Code. 
        In Windows, you can do this by right clicking on the folder and selecting "Open with VS Code".
        In MacOS, you can do this by dragging the folder to the VS Code icon in the dock. 
    Open the VS Code integrated terminal using Ctrl+`.
    Make sure that you are inside the nucampsite folder, then in your terminal, type:

npm init 

    Press enter through each of the prompts to accept the default values. 


Install dependencies

    Next, install the package dependencies for this project, making sure to use the provided version numbers: 

npm install lite-server@2.3.0 --save-dev

npm install bootstrap@4.0.0

npm install jquery@3.3.1 popper.js@1.12.9

    You will probably see some warnings and notices about newer versions. You can safely ignore them. 
    NOTE: the --save-dev flag means that lite-server is being installed as a development dependency, which means that later, when you build your project for deployment, it will not be included in the final build files, since it is only needed during development. 


Modify the package.json file

    Open the folder in VS Code from the command prompt, using:

code .

    Open the package.json file (this was created by the npm init command) and replace the description, main, and scripts objects with the below code:

. . .
  "description": "This is a website for the fictional campsites review site NuCamp.",  "main": "index.html",
  "scripts": {
    "lite": "lite-server",
    "start": "npm run lite",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
 },
. . .

    In the scripts object, make sure that each line inside the curly braces ends with a comma, except for the final one.
    The lines that you are adding to the scripts object will cause the lite-server application to run when you use the npm start command. 
    You can set your name as the value for "author". 


Create your course project's homepage

    Next, in VS Code, create a new file in the nucampsites project folder and name it index.html. Add the code below to this file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>NuCamp: A Better Way To Camp</title>
</head>

<body>

    <header>
        <div>
            <h1>NuCamp</h1>
            <h2>a better way to camp</h2>
        </div>
    </header>

    <div>
        <h2>Discover & Review</h2>
        <h3>Our Campsites</h3>
        <p>Explore our growing database of curated campsites and leave your own reviews!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Featured Campsites</h2>
        <h3>React Lake Campground</h3>
        <p>Nestled in the foothills of the Chrome Mountains, this campground on the shores of the pristine React Lake is a favorite for fly fishers.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Our Community Partners</h2>
        <h3>Bootstrap Outfitters</h3>
        <p>Bootstrap Outfitters supplies you with gear you need at prices you can't beat.</p>
    </div>

    <footer>
        <div>
            <h5>Links</h5>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Sites</a></li>
                <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h5>Social</h5>
            <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>
            <a href="http://facebook.com/">Facebook</a>
            <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>
            <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a>
        </div>
        <div>
            Tel: 1-206-555-1234<br />
            Email: campsites@nucamp.co
        </div>
    </footer>

</body>

</html>

    From your bash terminal, now type:

npm start

    Using the scripts that you defined in package.json, npm will start lite-server, which will open the index.html page in your default browser.


Part 2: Bootstrap Code

    Now you will add the necessary code to index.html to be able to use Bootstrap in it.
    First, update the head element with this code:

. . .
<head>
    <!-- Required meta tags always come first -->
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" />

    <title>NuCamp: A Better Way To Camp</title>
</head>

. . .

    Then, after the closing footer tag but before the closing body tag, add this code to bring in the JavaScript files used by Bootstrap:

. . .
    </footer>

    <!-- jQuery must come first, then Popper.js, then the Bootstrap JavaScript plugins.-->
    <script src="node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.slim.min.js"></script>
    <script src="node_modules/popper.js/dist/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
    <script src="node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

</body>
. . .


Summary

    In this exercise, you have created a folder for your Bootstrap course project. You used NPM to install the necessary dependencies, and modified the package.json file to use lite-server. You created an index.html page, configured it to use the viewport meta tag, and linked the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files to it.


OPTIONAL: GIT

    From VS Code, create a .gitignore file inside the project folder, with the content:

node_modules

    From your bash terminal, inside the project folder, initialize a git repository with the command:

git init

    Add all new or changed files to the staging area, using the command:

git add .

    This next command will commit the staged files to your local git repository:

git commit -m "Your First Bootstrap Project"

    You can also set up and push to a remote repository for this project, if you wish. Revisit the chapter on remote repositories in the Git section to remember how, but instead of git-test for the remote repository name, use a more appropriate name such as nucamp-bootstrap.
